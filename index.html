    <h2>Challenge</h2>
    <p>The current ed.gov site contains an overwhelming amount of links to external sites, which gives users the impression that it serves as a directory. However, further exploration of the site indicates that the site wants to provide resources and data regarding all sects of education. Ultimately, the goal is to differentiate the purpose of the Department of Education's purpose from that of other federal education resources. The redesign targets three users: students & families, instructors, and administrators.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="design-process-content">
    <h2>Solution</h2>
    <p>To minimize the amount of links on a given page, the redesign will utilize the use of having a preview and a complimentary button to navigate to the external site. Additionally, the user can navigate to the secondary pages through the main navbar.</p>

      <h2>Usability Testing</h2>
      <p>I needed to gauge how users’ perceived the purpose of the site. In order to get a better understanding of the Ed.gov’s purpose, I conducted five usability interviews.</p>
      <p>There are four categories in the main navigation bar. All three tasks that I asked users pertained to two out of the three categories. The progression of this project will include conducting usability testing on the remaining categories. Here are a couple insights from the tests:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>The excessiveness of links makes it hard to determine the hierarchy of information.</li>
        <li>The lack of organization of search results is overwhelming.</li>
        <li>There is no preview of the information provided on external sites.</li>
      </ol>

      <h2>Color Accessibility</h2>
      <p>The project aims to help users better navigate Department of Education website. For this reason, my core focus is to bolster the site’s interface and navigation properties. A huge part of UI is accessibility. To inform the UI kit that I will use for the redesign, I conducted color accessibility tests. Four out of five of the main color themes passed the contrast test. The last color needed slightly more saturation to pass. </p>

    <div class="design-process-content">
      <h2>Heuristics</h2>
      <p>In addition to user insights and the accessibility tests, I made remarks to the appearance, content, navigation, and functionality of the site. First impressions inform how users, including myself, deduce the purpose of the site.</p>
      <p>The information architecture of the site has a defined hierarchy. The most important contents are ranked higher on the page. However, there are three main opportunities for growth:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Fuse the two navigation bars to centralize content.</li>
        <li>Create a FAQ section for the questions on the right.</li>
        <li>Rank featured content more highly on the page.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Proto to User Persona </h2>
      <p>I initially hypothesized that the ideal user would be a first-year undergraduate student. The magnitude of resources on the site concerning grants and student loans would be invaluable to someone that is unfamiliar with funding their education.</p>
      <p>One of the user testers is an educator. On the recipe of graduating from her undergraduate college, she searched Ed.gov for post-secondary grants and accreditation status. This broadened my understanding of why a user might gravitate to the site.</p>
      <p>For that reason, I made Anya slightly older and further into her college career. I kept the goal of finding financial resources consistent.</p>

      <h2>Card Sorting</h2>
      <p>Navigation is the main focus of the redesign. Card sorting gives me insight into user’s mental models. The way in which users understand content informs possible ways I can groups information in the mockup. To conduct the test, I had three testers collaboratively create affinity maps from a pile of 45 unsorted cards. Here are the results:</p>

    <div class="design-process-content">
      <h2>Updated Sitemap</h2>
      <p>Due to a significant amount of landing pages relating to publication, I added a “Press & Media” category to the main navbar. The “About Us” categories is a new addition. Previously, the section resided in the top navigation and footer. However, the font in the top navbar is small enough to overlook and interviewees complained about having to migrate beyond the fold to learn the purpose of the site.</p>
      <p>Ordering the secondary pages based on hierarchy enables users quickly find the content they often seek.</p>
      <img src="Img_Sitemap.png" alt="Sitemap">
    </div>

    <div class="design-process-content">
      <h2>Header Navigation</h2>
      <p>Users can now access secondary landing pages by hovering over the categories of the main navbar. Hovering over a category prompts the site to cast a drop-down that overlays the hero space.</p>
      <p>Hovering allows users to preview secondary categories without committing to a full action. Clicking would increase the time it takes to view information from other categories.</p>
      <h3>DESKTOP NAVBAR</h3>
      <h3>MOBILE NAVBAR</h3>
      <img src="Img_Header.png" alt="Desktop and Mobile Header Navigation">
      <p>Due to the constraints of the iPhone 13 screen, the main navigation is hidden in a hamburger menu. All arrows point right to indicate that there is more content for the user to view. Once the user clicks on said arrow, the icon turns 90° to bring their attention to the subcategories that drop down. The secondary pages are underlined to indicate that they are clickable.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="design-process-content">
      <h2>Footer Navigation</h2>
      <p>The footer of the original website consisted of the contents I migrated to the main navbar. Having the primary and secondary categories in the footer made the footer crowded. Users may not fully utilize the original footer due to it being the below the fold.</p>
      <p>The main difference between the desktop and mobile footer is the absence of the secondary pages on mobile devices. The design considered the ideal touch target (48x48 dp) and the possibility that users may not be able to accurately click on the intended secondary category.</p>
      <p>However, I wish to conduct more research to see if this is a significant accessibility issue.</p>

      <h2>Mobile Wireframes</h2>
      <p>The main goal of the mobile design is to present most relevant information in a digestible manner. The visible content should coax users to find out more information.</p>
      <p>One challenge I faced was determining the relevance of information. Ultimately, the preview of a section should:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Define the purpose of said section.</li>
        <li>Be brief.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The high-fidelity prototype incorporates the UI Style Guide. An interviewee mentioned that the type size of the body might not be legible on smaller screens. An A/B test could help illuminate whether the current type size poses as an accessibility issue.</p>
